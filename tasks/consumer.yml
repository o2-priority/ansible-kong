# Move to README:
#
# In v0.13.0, significant changes were made to how kong entities are configured.
# For instance e.g. introduction of route and service object, and deprecation of
# api object.
# As a result this role has undergone significant refactoring.
# For the time being, this role supports both old and new config formats.
# To use the new config format set `kong_use_old_config_format` to `false`
